SportsLine.com, Inc., formerly SportsLine USA, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "SportsLine" or the "Company"), is a leading Internet-based sports media company that provides branded, interactive information and programming as well as merchandise to sports enthusiasts worldwide. SportsLine produces and distributes original, interactive sports content, including editorials and analyses, radio shows, contests, games, fantasy league products and fan clubs. SportsLine also distributes a broad range of up-to-date news, scores, player and team statistics and standings, photos, audio clips and video clips obtained from CBS and other leading sports news organizations, as well as SportsLine's superstar athletes. SportsLine produces the official Web sites for several organizations including Major League Baseball, the PGA TOUR and NFL Europe League. In addition, SportsLine is the primary sports content provider for America Online, Excite and Netscape.
The Company has established a number of important strategic relationships to increase awareness of the SportsLine brand, build traffic on its Web sites and develop proprietary programming. In March 1997, SportsLine established a strategic alliance with CBS pursuant to which SportsLine's flagship Web site was renamed "cbs.sportsline.com" and receives extensive network television advertising and on-air promotion, primarily during CBS television sports broadcasts such as the NFL, the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament, NCAA Football, PGA Tour events, U.S. Open tennis and the Daytona 500. The CBS agreement was amended in February 1999 to extend its term through 2006. See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." The Company believes that its relationship with CBS, in particular the branding of its flagship Web site as "cbs.sportsline.com" and the promotion the Company receives on CBS television broadcasts, will enable it to establish SportsLine as a broadly recognized worldwide consumer brand. The Company also has distribution agreements and relationships with a number of other partners including America Online, Excite, Netscape, Westwood One, theglobe.com, Major League Baseball and the PGA TOUR. See "--- Strategic Relationships."
In May 1999, the Company established Sports.com Limited ("Sports.com") (formerly known as SportsLine Europe Limited) as a European-based, majority owned subsidiary. Intel Corporation, MediaOne Ventures and Reuters hold minority interests in Sports.com. In August 1999, the sports.com Web site was launched as the home of sports sites for fans of European sports, including soccer, rugby and cricket. Sports.com operates country-specific Web sites through locally based operating subsidiaries that deliver real-time, in-depth European sports content and programming that capitalizes on the Web's unique graphical and interactive capabilities. Sports.com has established local subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and France and plans to establish local subsidiaries in Germany, Italy and Spain within the next 12 months.
