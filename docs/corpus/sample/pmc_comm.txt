Fifty CHWs from each study group (n=100) were interviewed after the intervention period to identify their sociodemographic characteristics and perceptions of the training received, their roles in teaching mothers, their participation in CHW groups with their CS, and changes in themselves as a result of the training. CHWs were randomly selected from a list of active CHWs in each study cluster, proportional to the number of CHWs in each cluster. Interviews were conducted by nursing students from the local university following training and practice in interviewing techniques from expert interviewers. We used a closed-ended questionnaire adapted from Care Group program materials. All CSs (46) were interviewed following the intervention period for the same reasons as listed for the CHW interviews. In addition, the CS interviews aimed to identify their perceptions of collaboration with health personnel, community leaders, and local government. We adapted a closed-ended questionnaire developed for Care Group programs.

Purified recombinant His-p62 (NBP-44490) was from Novus Biologicals. The buffer used for all recombinant p62 reactions was 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. For immunoblot analysis, 50 ng GST-p62 or 26.3 ng His-p62 was treated as described. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 4X SDS-PAGE sample buffer. ROS reactions were carried out as follows: GST-p62 was exposed to the indicated molar ratios of NaOCl or H2O2 for 1 h at 37Â°C and the reactions were stopped with 100 mM methionine [18]; GST-p62 was exposed to increasing concentrations of peroxynitrite for 5 min at room temperature as previously described [19]; GST-p62 was exposed to increasing concentrations of DEA/NONOate for 20 min at room temperature as previously described [20]. Peroxynitrite and DEA/NONOate dilutions were prepared fresh in 0.1 M NaOH and 0.01 M NaOH, respectively, and the appropriate NaOH controls were carried out.
